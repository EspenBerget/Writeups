# Seeker of Ruin Writeup

This one was a lot of fun!

As a dyslectic the idea of a phonetics based language is exciting!

Might try the game :)

## How I Solved It
At first I tought the title of this challenge - Seeker of Ruin - might be a referance to a video game, but the
game I found - Seeker of the Ruins - while a puzzle game, did not produce any clues.

I left this one for a while and returned to it later. Trying a search the title again, and looking further down, past
the steam urls, there was a reddit post "Seeker of the ruin, leave here : r/TunicGame". Looking at this post it is obvious
I was on the right track.

The game - Tunic - is about a fox on an adventure, the adventure take the fox past many challenges and puzzles, among the
puzzles are those based on the language created by the games creator. This language is photonic based. It works by dividing
the words into symbols, where each symbols is composed of a consonant part and a vowel part. The symbols have a consisten
structure where the inner part is consonant and the outer part is vowels. The symbols are read from inner to outer unless
there is an o at the bottom. A word is formed by drawing a line between the symbols of the word.

A simble bit of searchin lead me to a translate page, and the rest was pretty streight forward, minus some awkward
pronounciation out loud to ensure the translate sounded right and figuring out the word. Luckily I was alone xD.

After sounding out the word I was left with the phrase:
"aym ckaebcher vhuh flag fockss wevh greenn toonneck"

This was easy to translate given that the phrase is very intune with all the other clues:

"aim chapture the flag fox with green tunic"

This was the flag, no SiktCTF part this time.
