# SkrÃ¥strek 3 / Slash 3

This one is pretty interesting. In was trivial for the once with the knowhow, but lacking that this one was an
adventure in redundancy and a single minded procue of false conviction.

The clue in this task says:
"This challenge is in norwegian for some extra spice ðŸ˜‰ Denne hytta har jeg sett fÃ¸r, men jeg vet ikke hvor. Kan du finne ut hva hytta heter?"

Translated it says:
"This challenge is in norwegian for some extra spice ðŸ˜‰ I've seen this cabin before, but cant remember where. Can you find it?"

Now, the english norwegian mix and the "extra spice" clue convinsed me this was a reference to "Halvor Bakke", a tv presenter
whos program revolves around styling and renovating cabins. He often uses phrases like "extra spice" in english,
so there you go, must be it right?!

Well after finding a website containing most of the cabins from the show, looking at those who can have anything to do with
/3, and trying them all, ensuring that my team gets the worst possible attempts to success ratio. I desided this is not the way.

Before all of this I had used exiftool on the image, but was disapointed with the result as the Sub-location field was
overwritten with the nonsens phrase, "repeat.anguished.frosted". I found this odd, but though they where merly random words.
Still convinced by my first theory at the time. However now that it was out of the question, the oddity of this text
stuck out to me. A simple chatgpt query revealed that this was the position indexing of a site called What3Word,
whos logo is ///, 3 slashes!

Ploting the phrase into the site immediatley reveled the location. Finally! and note to self, go slower next time,
reconnaissance before execution!
